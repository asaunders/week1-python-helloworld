week1-python-helloworld
=======================
This is the first in a series of 25 weekly Python applications; a self-directed effort to teach myself programming. 

This application, written in Python 2, is the most basic possible: when executed, it prints the phrase "Hello World!" on the display. Although the program itself is trivial, writing it is a means to teach familiarity with the technicalities of publishing software that do not involve writing lines of code. In this instance, to re-familiarize myself with creating GitHub repositories, creating new files in the repository, and documenting the program in a README file.
